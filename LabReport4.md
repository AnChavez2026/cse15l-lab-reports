Lab Report 4
==========

This Lab will be going over the following steps from the previous lecture:
1. Log into ieng6
2. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
3. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
4. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
5. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
6. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (pick any commit message!)

STEP 1: Log into ieng6
----
> While on VSC I opened up a new terminal by pressing crtl + shift + \`
> Inside the terminal `ssh <space> cs15lsp23hn@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter>` I didn't have to type in my password because i has previuosly linked my computer to my ieng6 account with a ssh key
>

> 
> And now I have successfully logged in to ieng6!

STEP 2: Clone repository from GitHub account
---
> Using the same terminal I will clone the repository by typing `git <space> clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7 <enter>` 
> I used special cases such `ctrl- c` from a text of my class page to copy and `ctrl- v` to paste it in the terminal
> 
> which the terminal clarified that it successfully cloned the repository:
