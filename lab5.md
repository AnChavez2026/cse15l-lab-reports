## What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?
Computer: Asus g14, operating system: Windows 11, web browser: Google chrome, terminal/editor: Visual Studio Code

## Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.
When running grade.sh bash with a file that is supposed to pass all the test, all the files are are succefully loaded into the grading area. After this, J Unit is supposed to run and then echo out that all test 
passed. However, my program is unable to run the j unit test and I am met with this error:

## Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.
My current working dirctory is ~/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/list-examples-grader which has all the files I need that allows me to run grade.sh script. My lab partner has the same program and his is able to run fine, so im think something might be wrong with my laptop.
